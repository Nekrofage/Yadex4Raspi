	<h2>What's in a name ?</h2>

<p>In its previous incarnation, Yadex was named <em>Yade</em>,
which means Yet Another Doom Editor. I later realized that this
name was already taken (by Yet Another Diagram Editor). I
decided that the easiest way to remedy this would be to append a
fifth letter. I chose "<em>x</em>" because it has a neat regular
shape and because it evokes both Unix and X and therefore
conveys an important political message <tt>;-)</tt>.

<p>The right way to typeset it is with a capital Y and the rest
in lower case. Think of it as of a proper noun.
